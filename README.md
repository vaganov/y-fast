# Y-fast trie

OK, back on track. Here's the roadmap:
- [x] add a self-balanced tree able to split in `O(ln N)`
- [ ] add an [elastic hash](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.02305)
- [x] refine X-fast trie implementation: parametrize key bit extraction
- [x] combine all above for the Y-fast trie

Stick around
